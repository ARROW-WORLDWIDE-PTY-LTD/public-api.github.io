      summary: "[Production] Find Available Delivery Periods"
      description: |
        Request a list of available delivery windows based on date range, trailer type, port and whether delivery is time-sensitive or not (ie. 30 minutes before or after the specified delivery window start).
        
        A delivery window is a range with a start time and an end time.  Eg. 07:00 - 07:59.  Delivery windows may vary based on Port and time of day, eg. Brisbane has a Delivery Window for 00:00 - 03:59.
        
        When sending an EDI message with a datetime, the datetime is allowed to be set anywhere within the window as long as there are available times.  Eg. if 07:00 - 07:59 has availability, you can in-turn request a delivery date time of 07:30.
        
        Note. The maximum date range is 7 days and if no dates are not set, it will default to today's date and the next 7 days.
        
        All date times sent and returned must be LOCAL time for the given Australian State where the port is located.  No UTC offset should be given.
        
        Response messages will take into account the transporter's delivery cut off rules.  For example, if requesting today at 3pm for availability starting from the next business, no response data for that day will be sent if the transporter's cut-off rule is set to 1pm.

        This endpoint provides transparency into billing by showing all cost line items associated with a container job.
        Users can filter by container number, port, and optionally by customer reference to ensure the correct job is retrieved.
        
        Unless an invoice number value is given, the items returned should be considered indicative only. No charges are final until an invoice has been sent. Via depot storage and other charges may be displayed here based on either the current date or the future expected delivery date.

        **IMPORTANT:** This endpoint returns only direct costs associated with the container itself.
        It does NOT include any costs for delivery or redelivery of cargo from that container, which are
        billed separately under a different job (freight load) - api coming in future.

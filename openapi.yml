      summary: Find Available Delivery Periods
      description: |
        Request a list of available delivery windows based on date range, trailer type, port and whether delivery is time-sensitive or not (ie. 30 minutes before or after the specified delivery window start).
        
        A delivery window is a range with a start time and an end time.  Eg. 07:00 - 07:59.  Delivery windows may vary based on Port and time of day, eg. Brisbane has a Delivery Window for 00:00 - 03:59.
        
        When sending an EDI message with a datetime, the datetime is allowed to be set anywhere within the window as long as there are available times.  Eg. if 07:00 - 07:59 has availability, you can in-turn request a delivery date time of 07:30.
        
        Note. The maximum date range is 7 days and if no dates are not set, it will default to today's date and the next 7 days.
        
        All date times sent and returned must be LOCAL time for the given Australian State where the port is located.  No UTC offset should be given.
        
        Response messages will take into account the transporter's delivery cut off rules.  For example, if requesting today at 3pm for availability starting from the next business, no response data for that day will be sent if the transporter's cut-off rule is set to 1pm.
